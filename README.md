## Overview and Project Goals
The [goal](https://frontend.turing.edu/projects/module-3/rancid-tomatillos-v3.html) of this paired partner project that was made at [Turing School of Software and Design](https://turing.edu/) is to build a React APP similiar to Rotten Tomatoes that uses live APIs.

## Why was this project created?
To solidify and demonstrate the understanding of:
1. Gain competency with React fundamentals
2. Write modular, reusable code that follows SRP
3. Create a multi-page UX using Router
4. Learn how to test React components & asynchronous JS
